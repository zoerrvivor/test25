# Test25 – Hobby Artillery Game

## Purpose

**Test25** is a small, fun, turn‑based artillery game built with **MonoGame**.  It lets players (or simple AI opponents) control tanks, aim, adjust power, and fire a variety of weapons (standard shells, MIRVs, lasers, drones, rollers, etc.) across a destructible terrain.  The game features:
- Procedurally generated terrain with pixel‑perfect destruction.
- A basic weather system (wind) that influences projectile trajectories.
- A shop system, persistent settings, and a simple UI built from custom GUI controls.
- AI personalities that give each computer‑controlled tank a distinct play style.

## Hobby Project Disclaimer

This project is **purely a hobby effort** by a self‑taught developer who enjoys tinkering with game programming.  It is **not** a commercial product, nor does it aim for production‑grade polish.  Expect a learning‑oriented codebase, occasional rough edges, and a lot of experimentation.  Feel free to explore, modify, and use it as a reference for your own indie projects!
